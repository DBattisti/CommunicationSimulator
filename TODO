Roadmap/TODO
------------

Add support to additional specializations in sample_bt_agent
	(already present in sample_agent)

Move sample/testing programs to their own sources

Fragment healthd in several modules

Connection/disconnection callback: move from plugins to core,
removing the need of having every plugin implementing a listener
for the application (make every plugin implement those callbacks)

Handle unit multiples (*_X_* names)

Add unit testing cases for Agent and PM-Store.

Add unit testing cases for GetConfiguration and PMStore ops

Timer alarm review

Transcoding:
	Blocking/rerouting of requests like PM-Store

Add System-Type-Spec-List (and others) for Agent

PMStore get wrong value x timeout

PMStore ROER

USB: SIGINT does not exit main loop when a USB device
     has been disconnected while reading

Add checksum to extended configuration cache file

Migrate from dbus-glib to glib-included bindings for
D-Bus (since glib 2.26).

Simplification of confirmed request resending/timeout
reporting.

State machine: evaluate the possibility of removing
FSMEventData.


3) Low priority

ASN.1: use "open" stream writers, no need to specify count.

ASN.1: mitigate the need of Any structures. Points:
	* handle Anys in decoder level
	* soft error (choice unknown) x hard errors
		(stream underflow)
	* currently, decoder reports all errors as hard
	* many 'flavors' of Any in every place it is used,
	  each one with union of possible decoded outcomes.

Clearer, simpler rules of ownership, in particular when
involving APDU data. (This will be easier once the
need of pre-encoding Any types is eliminated.)

Search for FIXMEs and TODOs in code and deal with them

Try to reduce module coupling, with is currently very high.

Try to remove 'special' state machine handling code from
manager.c and agent.c; state machines should operate as
autonomously as possible. Create more states to achieve
that, if needed.

Improve timeout cases that could be handled by plug-in
(e.g. HDP reconnections)

Serialize transcoding Requests
Unify Requests for native and transcoded devices

Implement proper request/count timeout in agent AARQ

USB: SIGINT does not exit main loop when a USB device
     has been disconnected while reading

Add fragmentation tests

remove (harmless) write() failure in unit tests

Think about moving octet logging from TCP plug-in
to core
