Roadmap/TODO
------------

ROER and RORJ
	- pmstore
	- get mds attributes

Add support to additional specializations in sample_bt_agent
	(already present in sample_agent)

Add DiscoverServices call to sample_bt_agent

Add JSON API to healthd, test_healthd etc.

Move sample/testing programs to their own sources

Fragment healthd in several modules

Handle unit multiples (*_X_* names)

Add unit testing cases for Agent and PM-Store.

Add unit testing cases for GetConfiguration and PMStore ops

Add more multithreading/with concurrency unit testing cases

Transcoding:
	Blocking/rerouting of requests like PM-Store

Add System-Type-Spec-List (and others) for Agent

Add checksum to extended configuration cache file

Migrate from dbus-glib to glib-included bindings for
D-Bus (since glib 2.26).

TODOs/FIXMEs in code

ASN.1: use "open" stream writers, no need to specify count.

ASN.1: mitigate the need of Any structures and intermediate
       encoding. Create helper functions

Try to reduce module coupling, with is currently very high.

Try to remove 'special' state machine handling code from
manager.c and agent.c; state machines should operate as
autonomously as possible. Create more states to achieve
that, if needed.

Improve timeout cases that could be handled by plug-in
(e.g. HDP reconnections)

Serialize transcoding Requests
Unify Requests for native and transcoded devices

Implement proper request/count timeout in agent AARQ

USB: SIGINT does not exit main loop when a USB device
     has been disconnected while reading

Add fragmentation tests

remove (harmless) write() failure in unit tests

Think about moving octet logging from TCP plug-in
to core
